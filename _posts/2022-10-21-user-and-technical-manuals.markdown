<div class = "numbers"><b>other thoughts</b></div>
The main purpose of the user/technical manual is to connect customers to the company that provides the product. The user manual must be able to properly communicate instructions to the customers; otherwise, regardless of how helpful a product can potentially be, if the customers are not able to utilize it properly, the product is ultimately rendered useless.

Each of the user manuals above are structured in different ways. Whereas some are more text-heavy—like the Nexus 7 guidebook—others rely more on visuals—such as the GRIGRI manual. Nonetheless, the genre of user manuals is rigid in the sense that there are certain guidelines for the content and design of these guidebooks. In terms of content, manuals need to use simple, plain language. Instructions are often step-by-step, concise, and easy to understand. Descriptions of common scenarios as well as troubleshooting tips are provided as well. 

As for the design, user manuals often utilize visuals. The font should be large and legible—the example manuals all utilized sans-serif fonts, which are usually easier to read. The design should also be consistent throughout the entire manual; not only is this more visually pleasing, but it also helps customers navigate the content.
