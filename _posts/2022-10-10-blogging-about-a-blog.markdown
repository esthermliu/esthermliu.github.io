As a former member of Pro Sports Club, I have always been impressed by the club’s overall visuals. Unsurprisingly, their blog—"360 Degrees”—fits well into the club’s “health and fitness” theme as well. 

The “360 Degrees” blog succeeds in capturing its audience by utilizing casual, informal, and concise language. Often, the blogger presents a “modern,” “relatable,” and “down-to-earth” persona to avoid coming off as condescending when giving advice about physical and mental wellness; the club consequently feels more approachable and welcoming. In addition to addressing their audience of casual gym-goers, “360 Degrees” appeals to more serious health gurus by employing nutrition-related jargon in relevant blog posts, increasing the credibility of both the blogger and the club as a whole. 

In terms of integrating Pro Sport Club’s products, “360 Degrees” smoothly advertises the gym’s classes in a genuine manner. The blogger writes in first-person, describing their experience in detail and explaining what the potential benefits of the class are. Throughout the post, the blogger maintains a casual, relaxed style, almost as if the blogger is speaking to the audience as a close friend. 

Finally, the blog is visually appealing. There is a consistent design across the blog—minimalistic and clean with occasional highlights of light colors—that appropriately matches the healthy, wholesome, and optimistic ambience of the club.
